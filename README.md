# Movie-Review-Analysis-using-Machine-Learning
* Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a technique used to determine the sentiment or emotional tone expressed in a piece of text or speech. 
* While sentiment analysis has been widely applied to text data, there is a growing need to extend this capability to speech data. Analyzing sentiment in speech can provide valuable insights in various applications, such as customer service, market research, and voice assistants.
* The project goal: Build an open-source model to predict sentiment in spoken language and audio or real-time speech using melspectograms, effectively and accurately.

# Scope of the System
* Capturing Emotional Nuances: Speech sentiment analysis captures the emotional nuances and tonal variations present in spoken movie reviews. This provides a more comprehensive understanding of audience sentiments compared to traditional text-based reviews.
* Insight into Viewer Experience: By analyzing spoken reviews, filmmakers and studios gain deeper insights into how viewers emotionally experience their films. This information is crucial for refining storytelling techniques and tailoring content to audience preferences.
* Real-Time Feedback: Speech sentiment analysis enables real-time monitoring of audience reactions. Filmmakers can gauge immediate responses during screenings or upon release, allowing for quick adjustments or targeted marketing strategies.
* Improving Content Creation: Filmmakers can use speech sentiment analysis to fine-tune storytelling, character development, and cinematography based on audience reactions. This iterative process contributes to the continuous improvement of content creation.

# System Architecture
* Audio Data Collection: Collects diverse movie review audio files from different sources.
* Data Preprocessing: Cleans and preprocesses transcribed text to enhance sentiment analysis.
* Feature Extraction: Extracts relevant features from preprocessed text for sentiment analysis.
* Sentiment Analysis Model: Machine learning model for sentiment classification.
* Database: Stores and retrieves processed data with the help of MySQL or NoSQL database.
* Security Module: Ensures the security of user data and system functionality. Encryption Mechanisms for Audio File Transmission and Storage to be followed.
