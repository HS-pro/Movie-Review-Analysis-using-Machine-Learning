# Movie-Review-Analysis-using-Machine-Learning
Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a technique used to determine the sentiment or emotional tone expressed in a piece of text or speech. 
While sentiment analysis has been widely applied to text data, there is a growing need to extend this capability to speech data. Analyzing sentiment in speech can provide valuable insights in various applications, such as customer service, market research, and voice assistants.
The project goal: Build an open-source model to predict sentiment in spoken language and audio or real-time speech using melspectograms, effectively and accurately.
